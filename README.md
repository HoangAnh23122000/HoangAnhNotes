# HoangAnhNotes

# 1. Introduction
- The app HoangAnhNotes work almost like the app Note on Iphone
- I chose to build a simple note-taking app and focus on basic features such as add, delete and displaying notes.
- Currently the app only supports the basic features of a notes app and can't meet advanced or diverse requirements.

# 2. Timeline
- Find documents and designs: 1 day
- User interface development: 1.5 day
- Handle logic, database processing and fix bug : 1.5 day
- Write tests, clean code and write docs: 1 day

# 3. Design Pattern 
- The app use MVVM because it separates logic and UI. This make it easier for me to read, maintain and reuse

# 4. Flow
- User creates a note
- Manage your note list and sort by date of most recent note create from top to bottom
- User delete a note
