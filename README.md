# HoangAnhNotes

# 1. A brief outline of my approach
- I chose to build a simple note-taking app and focus on basic features such as add, delete and displaying notes.

# 2. How much time I spent on which aspects of the app
- Find documents and designs: 1 day
- User interface development: 1.5 day
- Handle logic, database processing and fix bug : 1.5 day
- Write tests, clean code and write docs: 1 day

# 3. Any know issues or limitations of the solution
- Currently the app only supports the basic features of a notes app and can't meet advanced or diverse requirements.
- The app can be affected when many users access it at the same time.
- Error may occur when syncing data across multiple devices without good sync management.
